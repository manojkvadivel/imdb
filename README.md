imdb web scrapping

Problem Statement
IMDB provides a list of celebrities born on the current date. Below is the link:
http://m.imdb.com/feature/bornondate
Get the list of these celebrities from this webpage using web scraping (the ones that are displayed i.e top 10). You have to extract the below information:
•	Name of the celebrity
•	Celebrity Image
•	Profession
•	Best Work
Once you have this list, run a sentiment analysis on twitter for each celebrity and finally the output should be in the below format
•	Name of the celebrity:
•	Celebrity Image:
•	Profession:
•	Best Work:
•	Overall Sentiment on Twitter: Positive, Negative or Neutral
